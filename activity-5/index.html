    <h1>The 2 Best Visual Studio Code Extensions for Front End Developers</h1>
    <img src="images/visual-studio-code-extensions.webp" alt="Banner">
    <p>Great tooling can help developers write faster, cleaner, and more consistent code. Visual Studio Code extensions allow
    you to add tools, languages, debuggers, and more, to help you do just that. A while back, I asked front end developers
    here at Shopify what extensions, packages, and plugins they couldn't live without.
    
    Based on those conversations, I wrote two articles about the best Sublime Text plugins and the best Atom packages for
    front end developers. In this article, I've highlighted my top picks for Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions, and
    broken them down into the following six categories. If you want to ensure that what you're building is secure, you can

        <p>The IntelliSense for CSS class names extension helps to autocomplete class names for the HTML class attribute by looking
        at the CSS class definitions in your workspace, and external files referenced through the link element.</p>
